         *  Santa is handing out gifts in the kindergarten.
         *  Many toddlers are around there and everyone should have the opportunity to have a seat on Santa's lap.
         *  But there's Peter, a 5 year old boy, who is a bit naughty. He tries to get two gifts.
         *  After he got the first one, he lines up again in the queue of children.

         But fortunately Santa is not alone. His elves keep a list with the names of the children, which already were on Santa's lap.
         We know, that each name name is unique. If a name tries to get a second gift, the elves will tell Santa.

         OK, let's help Santa and his elves with a simple function handOutGift() (hand_out_gift in Ruby) which takes the name of the next name.
         If this name already got a gift, it must throw an error in order to remind Santa.

         Javascript Example:

         handOutGift("Peter");
         handOutGift("Alison");
         handOutGift("John");
         handOutGift("Maria");
         handOutGift("Peter"); // <-- must throw an error
         */
        function handOutGift(name) {
            var kids = this;
            if (kids[name]) {
                throw 'has already got!';
            }
            kids[name]=true;
        }
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        module("One gift per child");
        test('get more than 1 times', function () {
            handOutGift("Peter");
            throws(function () {
                handOutGift("Peter");
            });
        });
    </script>
